# Civilizations
Civilizations is an exercise in procedural generation and simulation. The goal is to be able to randomly produce a fantasy-like world populated with expansive biomes, empires, their populace, creatures, etc. Initial development focuses on the underlying algorithms and as such graphics are not necessary for some time.
